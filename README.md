# Vehicle-Detection-Counting
A computer vision project that detects, tracks, and counts vehicles in highway videos using object detection and tracking. It draws bounding boxes around vehicles, assigns unique IDs, and updates the total count each time a vehicle crosses a counting line. Useful for traffic analysis and intelligent transport systems.
